	<p>'The Container' is a realtime 3D space.</p>

		Description:<br>
		'The Container' v.1.0 is the setup of a future realtime live environment.
		infused with live streams, (data-driven) parameters and surfaces to project on, objects and notes to leave. A playground aka a live scape.
		
		it will turn into a live 'exhibition/conference/VR space. The first of such kind.
		
		deep into that scape. create an environment that is dedicated to next-fresh fem.tech unfoldings/additive technologies, non-racist maths, - and yes within it, we will be able to dance. maybe tomorrow, maybe next year..
		
		With the many sounds and streams of relevant real time streams, combined into a polyphony. Morphing that space with the flows, surplusing their dimensions. Watching knots blossom. Towards complex sphere compositions: - What was the light like?
		<br><br>
		ROADMAP<br>
		opening a clear defined frame a .teaser, a canvas, a virtual spatiotemporal scape. HERE it is!
		Within: struggling, mapping, slow gates & processors and those unsophisticated exchange rules plus the missing combining framework, that includes all of such possibilities. -> 
		
		//SOFT also the question of ‘perfection’ composition towards randomness and control, ///the true line, never triggered in linear code, plain narration, one string. it must always have more then one dimension, more then two, because it is the polyplex structure of in-between augmenting next? translat:d? the upwinding of a form. towards, time.?
		<br><br>
		To open that room:
		to represent the space and map it to geospatial ‘truth’..
<br><br>
/Version 1.0
Toward stable spaces:
node representation in next augmented scape.
technical overview and testing.
it starts with a 3 dimensional box, in which can be mapped. 

built in p5.js / three.js / x3dom


Investigations:

1. SPACE rep
that space. depth of the canvas/scene/ other determinations of the scape, dimensions, parameters, groups, namespaces, ‘effectivals’, possible triggers and transformations, translocations and polyspheres and its merge forms. 

dimensional compositions (bind to existing frameworks :GIS :X3D :ontologies)
3+D (on web).  augmented.
 frameworks (xml3D, x3dom, Unity+C, ..), 

geo and GIS allocation (fixing it to real time map/globe/“physical location within the universe”), its enlargening ontologies and namespaces, its autoconnections


2. REAL TIME

gating and triggering.

-> implement realtime (sensor) data, 
( satelite data, else?) for what gates? e.g. to take those strings as parameters for and give an interface for effective triggers.


3. INTERACTION

/POV controller movement and multiscape
/input
/…later: shaking the x/y/z achsis.			</p>
<p class="comment">'more on those investigations will be available as a dirty link list, projected onto any surface in a corner of that space.</p>
<p class="comment">'Please think of the underwater live sounds for yourself for now.</p>


<p class="comment">'At least we have ISS Space Station live data feed yet.</p>

<p class="comment">'#SOUND - audio strems still need to be embeded. The pan flutist is a dummy.</p>
